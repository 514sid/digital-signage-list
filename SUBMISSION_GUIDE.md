# Submission Guide

Welcome to SignageList! This guide will help you submit new digital signage products or update existing ones.

## 🤝 Transparent Curation Process

We accept submissions through **GitHub Issues** to maintain a transparent curation process. This means:

- **Public Review**: All submissions are visible to the community
- **Open Discussion**: Anyone can comment on and review submissions
- **Community Input**: The community can help verify information and suggest improvements
- **Trackable History**: All changes and decisions are publicly documented
- **Quality Assurance**: Multiple eyes help ensure accuracy and completeness

This approach ensures that our digital signage directory remains trustworthy, accurate, and community-driven.
