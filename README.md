## Fire OS notes

For every product that lists Android as a supported platform, we are also including Fire OS.

> Fire OS is the operating system that runs Amazon's Fire TV and tablets. Fire OS is a fork of Android, so if your app runs on
> Android, it will most likely run on Amazon's Fire devices too. As a developer, you might not have to adjust your Android code > at all to publish your app on Amazon's OS.
